# Tracking Avian Migration Patterns: A Spatio-Temporal Analysis
- Tracked the movement of three gulls—Eric, Nico, and Sanne—using GPS data from the LifeWatch INBO project.
- Visualized longitude and latitude data, speed variation, time taken to cover equal distances, daily mean speed, and a cartographic view of their journey.
- Analyzed and plotted the data using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, Cartopy, and Shapely.
